                <h2 class="h-secondary center">Bulk Ordering</h2>
                <p class="center">An order to buy a large quantity of a good at once. This may occur at either the retail or the wholesale levels.
                     For example, a coffee shop may make a bulk order for coffee because it needs to sell to its customers. 
                     An individual may order the same amount simply because he/she does not want to go shopping for it very often.
                     Buying in bulk is often less expensive per unit than buying otherwise, because marginal costs tend to decrease 
                     the more a company produces or sells.</p>

                <p class="center">Online Food Delivery has been there for a long time. Before third party aggregators came in
                     to the picture, remember all that direct calling you did to have the pizzas delivered to your doorstep? 
                     There weren’t online order aggregators and there were no food delivery apps or websites. It’s only in the 
                     last decade that the likes of Swiggy, Foodpanda and Zomato have entered the online food delivery business, 
                     streamlined the entire process,
                     got many small and large restaurants and centralised (to an extent) the whole food delivery process.</p>
